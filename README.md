# Ruby Program

Took a set of instructions (which I have been written into user stories below) and created this program to display the given data


## User Stories

```
As a user             
So that I can access all webpages              
I want to be able to open the file                      
```
```
As a user                
So that I can view pages with the most views                
I want to display them in descending order                                 
```
```
As a user                 
So that I can view pages with the most unique views                   
I want to display them in descending order             
```
